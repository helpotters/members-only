# README

A Ruby on Rails project. 

Details: 
* Devise
* Redcarpet
* Bulma CSS
* Ruby version: 3.0.2

## General

This is a simple website where users may make text posts to a public feed.

What makes this unique:
- Markdown-support
- Posters are anonymous by default unless the current users signs in
- The public feed only shows titles in a reddit-like style (and the OP's username if the current user signs in)
